## The Goal
This project is intended for being able to more easily connect dots when learning convoluted mathemtical concepts.
Having all the proofs in one single place is the first step, and being able to free-text search through them is the first step.
After that, each proof should have a a detailed explanation of the proof. Within that explanation I should be able to navigate to related proofs.
This basic idea of being able to drill-down into any proof all the way to the most basic axioms is the epitome of understading a concept.
## The Future
After the basic idea is implemented, there are a few useful features I'd like to add:
* A way to add new proofs - Will help me a lot when learning new courses.

## What now
* I'm currently working on the basic idea of the project. I'm using the [Lean Theorem Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/) to write the proofs, and I'm using [Lean's API](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/lean4-api-doc/) to extract the proofs into a JSON file.
